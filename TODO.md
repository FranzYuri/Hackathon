| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Improve pressure export | Improve the exportation of pressure values to facilitate the simulation of the apoggee detection algorithm. It currently supports the "noisy" pressure output only after parachutes have been defined. | Medium | None |
| Optimize coefficients for the detection algorithm | Optimize the detection filter coeffitients for the specific launch. | Hard | Adaptive Digital Filtering and C++ |
| PyRX + RocketPy | Integrate the GUI telemetry software PyRX with RocketPy | Medium | None |
| Maximal distance | Calculate the maximal distance between the rocket and the Telemetry base station. The objective is to improve the choosing and testing of the antennas. | Medium | None |
| Implement deployable Payload simulation | Allow RocketPy to simulate the trajectory of objects deployed during flight | Hard | Dynamics |
